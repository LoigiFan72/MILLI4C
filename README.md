# Mario and Luigi Dream Team Decompilation / Project MILLI4C

This is a early work in progress, stay tuned for more!

This is currently targetting the 1.0 US Build of the game but will soon expand to other versions.
Currently this project is going through a "setup" phase, meaning it may take while for us to get some actual work done.

# Building the rom

I will not share building the rom yet, as I am using a temporary method to do so.

# The Goal

1:1 Functionality of the code.bin
As of currently,  only the code.bin is being targeted. No CROs *yet*. Nor will be building of the RomFS be targeted ethier.
I myself don't care for a PC Port of a 3Ds game. But, once finished I will not care if someone forks it and makes a PC Port for themselves.

# How to help

Currently the "team" is small. And, we need more people. So if you wanna join the project, ot help out do so.
